Modern C++ utility library for isl.

## Build instructions

Dependencies are fetched via git submodules.  Since they don't use cmake, we
rely on cmake external projects to run the autoconf/configure/make toolchain.
This is done by `make pet` below, which only has to run in the first build or
after submodule update.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake .
make pet
make
```
